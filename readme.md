# [Build Google Maps Using Web Components & No Code!](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/polymer-maps/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0)

In this codelab, You'll create a fully working Google Maps app using elements in Polymer's [Google Web Components](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=google-web-components) collection. The app will be responsive and will include driving directions and transit mode. Along the way, you'll also learn about Polymer's data-binding features and [iron element](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=iron-elements) set.  DONE ðŸ˜‰ - publish to github pages...
